I wake up exhausted, even in the morning
Like I'm made out of decaf, I'm barely running
Oh, and I hate parties
It's just too many bodies
I don't like small talk, I'm always leaving early
Then I met you and my eyes changed
And now you're in my eye range, I'm gunning for you
You changed my heart in a big way
Now every day's a celebration and I wanna say
When you're around, it's already alright
Already alright, like a radio
I'm tuning into you
(I'm tuning into you)
You're turning me on
(You're turning me on)
And I'm my own person, not like I need protection
It's just that I wanna change and go in your direction
God, you're a laser beam
You're all my teen dreams
And if I knew you in school, you'd be too cool for me
Then I met you and my eyes changed
And now you're in my eye range, I'm gunning for you
You changed my heart in a big way
Now every day's a celebration and I wanna say
When you're around, it's already alright
Already alright, like a radio
I'm tuning into you
(I'm tuning into you)
You're turning me on
(You're turning me on)
You make me feel like I could dance all night
Already all night, like a live wire
I'm always louder with you
(I'm always louder with you)
Keep turning me on
(Keep turning me on)
Up, up, up, up
When I get down, when I get down
When I get
Up, up, up, up
When I get down, when I get down
When I
When you're around, it's already alright
Already alright, like a radio
I'm tuning into you
(I'm tuning into you)
You're turning me on
(You're turning me on)
You make me feel like I could dance all night
Already all night, like a live wire
I'm always louder with you
(I'm always louder with you)
Keep turning me on
(Keep turning me on)
When you're around, it's already alright (keep turning me up, up, keep turning me up, up)
Already alright, like a radio (keep turning me up, up, keep turning me)
I'm tuning into you
(I'm tuning into you)
You're turning me on
(You're turning me on)
You make me feel like I could dance all night (keep turning me up, up, keep turning me up, up)
Already all night, like a live wire (keep turning me up, up, keep turning me)
I'm always louder with you
(I'm always louder with you)
Keep turning me on
(Keep turning me on)
When you're around, it's already alright
Already alright, like a radio
I'm tuning into you
(I'm tuning into you)
You're turning me on
(You're turning me)
